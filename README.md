# -Get-Familiar-with-ML-basics-in-a-Kaggle-Competition


In this 1-hour long project, you will be able to understand how to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck and make your first submission in an Machine Learning competition inside the Kaggle platform. Also, you as a beginner in Machine Learning applications, will get familiar and get a deep understanding of how to start a model prediction using basic supervised Machine Learning models. We will choose classifiers to learn, predict,  and make an Exploratory Data Analysis (also called EDA). At the end, you will know how to measure a model performance, and submit your model to the competition and get a score from Kaggle. 

This guided project is for beginners in Data Science who want to do a practical application using Machine Learning. You will get familiar with the methods used in machine learning applications and data analysis. 

In order to be successful in this project, you should have an account on the Kaggle platform (no cost is necessary). Be familiar with some basic Python programming, we will use numpy and pandas libraries. Some background in Statistics is appreciated, like as knowledge in probability, but itâ€™s not a requirement.
